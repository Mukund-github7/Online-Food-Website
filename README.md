# Online Food Ordering Website
This repository contains a basic implementation of an online food ordering website. This project was developed by Mukund-github7 as a learning exercise.
Users can view menus, sign up for accounts, and log in to place orders. The project includes front-end HTML/CSS for the user interface and client-side validation.
